Liquids - Water and Blood
NeatWolf's Particle FX Pack 02
(more packs (Fire, Spells) at unbeatable per-FX price at: http://u3d.as/8GL or, to open the store in-editor: http://u3d.as/8GL)

This FX Pack is mainly oriented to generic Liquids, Water and Blood.
Yet, by simply changing the alpha and color, you may use them for acid, supernatural fluids, dark matter and toxic waste effects.

All the assets are built to be easily tweakable and recolorable, within the limits of Unity

In particular, you may want to tweak the alpha color of the prefabs to match your style. Currently their alpha is set to be pretty high, for a cartoonish look, but feel free to lower it to get more realistic results.

Feel free to duplicate the prefab and move it in another folder of your project if you like to make small adjustments: it'll help when updating the package: you'll get the new updated version of the prefab while still keeping your changes.

Note: this particle systems do not use the new features of Unity 5.5.x *yet*, as I prefer to wait a bit until they will be tested by the community, bug-free and definitive.

How to use:

- Open the NeatWolf folder in your Project View
- Open the desired category you have in mind: (eg: Water)
- Drop the prefab onto the scene, and you're ready to go!

NOTE: I removed all the scripts from the package, to avoid unnecessary warnings when importing from different versions.
The scripts only included the Standard Assets folder included in a standard Unity installation.
This has also been done to follow the good practices submission guidelines and to avoid conflicts with new/obsolete versions.
This means that if you like to have a walk through the included demo scenes, you have to manually import the First Person Controller
from the Standard Assets which are available as part of the Unity installation and drag and drop one in the scene.
In this way, you'll be always using the most up-to-date version of the Standard Assets, with no version conflicts.

**** Showing the hierarchy in alphabetical order ****
If your Unity version supports it, you may reorder the hierarchy view to show all the assets in alphabetical order

- In the upper main menu, open the Edit menu and click on Preferences
- In the General tab, in the right pane, check Enable AlphaNumeric Sorting
- In the Hierarchy tab, a new button should have appeared  in its upper right corner, a big A with some lines
- Pressing it you can choose to switch back and forth from alphabetical ordering to standard Transform sorting
According to what I know, this should't change your transform order, so you should always be free to switch back to it when needed

**** IMPORTANT ****
Suggested ways to tweak the prefabs:
(in this way you won't risk to accidentally overwrite the assets of this package.
Also, as the asset gets updated, having a separate prefab to work on will prevent the updated versions of the prefabs to overwrite your changes):

++++ Method 1 ++++
- Drag and Drop the prefab on the scene
- Tweak it
- Create a new prefab by dragging it inside your project folder

++++ Method 2 ++++
- Select the prefab from the Project Tab you'd like to use in your project
- Press CTRL(or equivalent if you are on Mac) + D to duplicate the prefab in place
- Move and rename the new prefab to a position in your project 
- Drag the newly prefab in the scene if you want to instantiate it


**** TWEAKING ****
- Select the FX you want to tweak in the Scene View or in the Hierarchy if not visible (the particle simulation should start in the Scene View)
- Expand its hierarchy to show its children if available
- Change the Start Color(s) of the Particle System FX in the base object and of its children to match your needs. This also includes the alpha start value if the alpha is too high for your needs
- Expand the Emission module of both the parent and children particle system, to increase or decrease the amount of spawned particles per second to adapt it to your needs (mobile or desktop)

**** KNOWN ISSUE ****
latest Unity versions particle bounces against World are sometimes incorrect due to some internal changes about how Unity handles particles, so you may sometime see a particle bouncing in the wrong direction. This is not an issue of the asset.
Workaround: change the collider to a plane or similar shape.
